This project has been oryginally based all on React class components.
Mainly, my contribution into this project is that I have converted it using react hooks, fixed some bugs and added few features.
Working on it has given me great opportunity to improve my knowlege about programming, such as using react hooks, working with react-redux library, using firebase
back-end based platform or see how the files structure may look like in bigger projects.
